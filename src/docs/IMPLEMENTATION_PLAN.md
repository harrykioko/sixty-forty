## Longer Term Items

- Ultra-minimalist, trackless, translucent scrollbar for modals

  - Track should be fully transparent
  - Scope only to modal containers
  - Revisit after higher-priority issues are addressed

## üóëÔ∏è Files/Components to Delete After Migration
- `src/components/admin/form/ProductForm.tsx` (after both new forms are live)
- Any now-unused hooks or modal logic related to the old ProductForm
- Any legacy test files for the old ProductForm

# üìù Sixty40 Admin Dashboard ‚Äì Session Handoff

## What Was Accomplished (Previous Session)
- ‚úÖ Fixed import issues in several components:
  - Fixed toast import in SocialShare component
  - Updated import path from UI components to hooks directory
  - Documented common import patterns and issues
- ‚úÖ Updated documentation:
  - Added import issues section to component-structure.md
  - Updated implementation plan with import standardization tasks
  - Created guidelines for import paths and naming conventions
- ‚úÖ Identified patterns in import errors:
  - Hook imports from incorrect directories
  - Inconsistent use of kebab-case vs PascalCase
  - Mixed component locations causing confusion

## What to Focus on Next
- Continue fixing import errors throughout the codebase:
  - Audit and fix all hook imports
  - Standardize component import paths
  - Create automated import checking
- Standardize hook naming:
  - Convert remaining kebab-case hooks to camelCase
  - Update all dependent imports
  - Document naming conventions
- Improve development workflow:
  - Add ESLint rules for import paths
  - Create scripts for import verification
  - Update documentation with new standards

## Current Import Issues
1. Hook Location Issues:
   - Some hooks imported from `/components/ui` instead of `/hooks`
   - Inconsistent hook file naming (kebab-case vs camelCase)
   - Need to standardize import paths
2. Component Import Patterns:
   - Mixed use of kebab-case and PascalCase in imports
   - Inconsistent component locations
   - Need clear guidelines for import paths
3. Documentation Gaps:
   - Missing examples of correct import patterns
   - Unclear guidelines for component locations
   - Need better error documentation

## Next Immediate Tasks
1. Create comprehensive list of all import errors
2. Plan hook renaming sequence
3. Update import paths in affected components
4. Add automated import checking
5. Update documentation with new standards
6. Test all components after changes

## Guidelines
- Follow new import path conventions
- Use correct casing based on component type
- Test components after import updates
- Document any breaking changes
- Update related documentation

## Relevant Files
- [Component Structure](./component-structure.md)
- [Implementation Plan](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
- [UI Components](../components/ui/)
- [Hooks Directory](../hooks/)

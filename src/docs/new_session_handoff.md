# üìù Sixty40 Admin Dashboard ‚Äì Session Handoff

## What Was Accomplished (Previous Session)
- Extracted shared `ProductFormFields` component for product add/edit flows
- Updated implementation plan to split product form into `CreateProductForm` and `EditProductForm`
- Documented files/components to delete after successful migration
- Maintained all changes in line with Sixty40 admin dashboard standards

## What to Focus on Next
- Refactor legacy `ProductForm` to use `ProductFormFields`
- Implement `CreateProductForm` (empty/default values, create logic)
- Implement `EditProductForm` (prepopulated, update logic)
- Refactor modal state management to distinguish add vs. edit
- Update parent handlers to open correct form/modal
- Test add, edit, and cancel flows for both forms
- Remove legacy `ProductForm` and related code after confirming new system works

## Relevant Documents & Files
- [Implementation Plan](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
- [ProductFormFields Component](../components/admin/form/sections/ProductFormFields.tsx)
- [Current ProductForm (to be refactored)](../components/admin/form/ProductForm.tsx)

## Guidelines
- Continue following Sixty40 glassmorphic and UX standards
- Use TailwindCSS utilities and shadcn/ui for advanced components
- Reference the implementation plan for current priorities and completed work
- Update this handoff doc after major session transitions
